int *x = new int[n]; // dynamically allocated variable

int x=5;

int *y = &x;

*y = 10;

cout << y;

y means memory location, u can use it to change value or initialize
*y is the value at memory location x

Actually, x[i] is a shorthand for *(x+i) in C/C++.
    The language defines “pointer arithmetic”.
